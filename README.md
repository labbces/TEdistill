# panTE

This is our script to generate a panTE library based on genome-specific EarlGrey TE libraries. It is heavily inspired in the panEDTA.sh from EDTA

# Installing

First clone out repo:

```
  git clone git@github.com:labbces/panTE.git
```

Then cd into the repo and add submodules

```
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
```

This will add out own copy of the EDTA repository, as we are using some of their scripts to generate the panTE
